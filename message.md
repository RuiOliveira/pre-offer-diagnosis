Hi! Thanks for your interest in my profile!

First of all, I have to apologize for replying to your message with a standard one, but I think it is better to give you feedback like this than give you no feedback at all.

Before engaging in a more active conversation I usually request this information:

1.  What is the tech stack?
2.  What is the (rough) size of the team?
3.  What are the expected responsibilities? (just dev work / mentor trainees / discussions with clients)
4.  What is the openness to remote working/working from home?
5.  What is the location of the office? (if there is an office)
6.  What is the salary range for this position? (we can be more precise later. bonus points if you give me the gross annual value)
7.  What is the vacation policy?
8.  If the amount of vacation days is lower than 30, is there the possibility to take extra (non-paid) days off?
9.  Are there any extra benefits I should be aware of?
10. How would you classify the current moral state of the team?
11. What will the recruitment process be like?
12. What is the company I'll be working? Of course, if you are not a recruitment agency, please ignore this one. If you can't say what is the company yet, that is fine but can you at least tell me in which area does it operate?

I know, it sure looks like a lot of questions. Still, they will allow me to evaluate if the proposal seems appealing and save you the time of a possible skype call that can be used more productively (like interviewing another candidate or relaxing, for example!)

No hard feelings if you don't reply.
I hope you have an awesome day!
