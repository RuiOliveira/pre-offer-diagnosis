# pre-offer-diagnosis
Have you ever received a message in LinkedIn from a recruiter from company X telling you that they have an extraordinary job opportunity and asking if it would be of your interest to have a quick chat about it? What about two of these? Or two hundred?

Exactly! It is impossible to answer back at all those messages, right?
Also, let's face it, you don't want to spend 30 minutes talking to a person regarding an opportunity for which you have no context nor clear expectations. On the other hand, you also don't want to feel like you may be missing a good opportunity because of lack of information.

To deal with this issue, I present you my Pre Offer Diagnosis!

TA-DA!
