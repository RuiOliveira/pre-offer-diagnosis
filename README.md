# pre-offer-diagnosis

Have you ever received a message in LinkedIn from a recruiter from company X telling you that they have an extraordinary job opportunity and asking if it would be of your interest to have a quick chat about it? What about two of these? Or two hundred?

Exactly! It is impossible to answer back at all those messages, right?
Also, let's face it, you don't want to spend 30 minutes talking to a person regarding an opportunity for which you have no context nor clear expectations. On the other hand, you also don't want to feel like you may be missing a good opportunity because of a lack of information.

And, of course, on the other side of the screen there is also a person doing it's own work and looking for people to fill a particular job opening. It is hard to look for people, being rejected constantly, not answered back at all or, worst, spending a lot of time with a candidate just to see all efforts laid to waste while negotiating conditions.

To deal with this issue, I present you my Pre Offer Diagnosis!

TA-DA!

The point of this message is to get all the information I need to save all that time. It's a mix of topics that I find important, that I would like to know and that (if I had no more information) would make me accept or reject the offer.
